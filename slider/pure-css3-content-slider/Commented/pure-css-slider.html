Browser Support: WebKit and FireFox

-----------------------------------------------

Usage: You are free to use and abuse this code anyway you'd like for any project (personal or commercial). Please don't directly redistribute and sell this code in any way (if you do, then you don't get a cookie). However, if you're interested in buying or selling this code, feel free to contact me at: caleb@iamceege.com

-----------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: If you are wanting to add or subtract to the current amount of slides (4), you will need to change all of the CSS keyframe animations in css/slider.css to reflect your changes. Unfortunately, this is one of the downfalls of stricltly using CSS.

-----------------------------------------------

If you do end up using this script or finding it helpful, I'd love to hear your thoughts and see what you've done with it! (caleb@iamceege.com)

Thanks! And enjoy! :)

		<div id="mask"><!-- This masks an unordered list (<ul>) while it's sliding from right to left. Here's an illustration of what's going on (The ='s are the slides and the [ ] is the mask):
		
						Slide 1:    [=]=== 
						Slide 2:   =[=]==
						Slide 3:  ==[=]=
						Slide 4: ===[=]
						
						In summary, as the unordered list moves from right to left, the mask ([ ]) will only show the content (portion of the unordered list) that is currently inside of it. If it weren't for this mask, you'd see all of the slides going across your window.
						-->
			<ul><!-- Sets up the previously mentioned unordered list. This will structure the slides and lay them out horizontally/inline with eachother (by default, an unordered list would display list items (<li>) vertically. However, with some CSS magic (display:inline;), the list items will line up horizontally -->

This goes to show that you can insert anything into the slides - even a video! This is why it's important for the slider to pause on mouseover. The pause will allow people to interact with whatever your slide contains - without it slapping them in the face and sliding away (that would suck)  -->
